        <h4><strong>About Me:</strong></h4>  Recently I had stepped into the Software Development field, I was inspired by my sister and close friends who have told me about their software/coding journey. 
        This was my first initial exposure to the field of software development. I first hand saw what was going on, I saw how apps came to life from scratch. 
        I saw how new items or objects were created simply from code. This piqued my interest and from then on, I was fueled by curiosity to keep on exploring the world of software. I am interested in software because it is fun, I want to be able to share my ideas, create my own apps from the ground up. Also to help out people with everyday problems, to make their lives easier. 
        I am interested in all the different languages that are offered. Lastly, I am curious to explore and experiment in the field of software development

            It started from a simple Youtube video to a Udemy Curriculum about web development, and lastly to graduating from a non-profit that teaches introduction to software development, Opportunities for a Better Tomorrow (OBT). 
            I would say that my journey in the software field has been steady and gradual. Upon graduating from OBT, I was given the opportunity to intern for a client's website. Here is where I was able to use the skills I had gained in CSS, HTML, and Javascript to create and adjust the website to the client's specific liking. 
            Sure it was challenging, but I took each day as a new challenge and gradually moved forward.

            For programming languages, I have taken an intro to Python, intro to SQL, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 
            Upon Graduating from OBT I also learned the foundations in Javascript which are the same for just about any higher-level language. 
            This includes booleans, conditionals, loops, functions, and arrays to name a few. 
            Seeing how each topic adds to paint a bigger picture in the code was truly important and helped shaped my understanding of Javascript and programming even more

            The reason why I want to become a TKH fellow is that I feel there is still so much that I do not know about software development. 
            I feel that The Knowledge House curriculum can help me to better understand the code that I am writing, and to think and solve problems like that of an software engineer. 
            Also, the skills that are provided by The Knowledge House can help me to become a much more successful candidate in this ever-growing competitive job market. 
            I know that this journey will not be easy, but I am willing to show up early, ready, and prepared to get to my goal.
